# Simulation Code for HAVOC

This code models the hardware in HAVOC and allows us to simulate running
autonomous commands on HAVOC without access the to actual bot.

Important notes:

- Be sure you are running the latest version of WPILib (2021.2.1), otherwise it will crash.
- Install the release candidate vendor deps for Phoenix from http://devsite.ctr-electronics.com/maven/development/com/ctre/phoenix/frcjson/5.19.5-rc-1/frcjson-5.19.5-rc-1-5.json
- Install the kauai labs vendor deps for NavX from https://www.kauailabs.com/dist/frc/2021/navx_frc.json
